Welcome to Springboard's online class Yesterday we discussed the syllabus and I told you how to read the syllabus of Rajasthan GK I also told you that we will see two portions one is the history of Rajasthan and the other is the culture of Rajasthan When we read the history we read the history of Rajasthan in many ways I also told you in yesterday's video that we will read an ancient history a medieval history and a modern history I also told you that in the ancient history of Rajasthan we get the information about the sites like Kalibanga Ahad, Berat what we got from Madhyamika what we got from Noha what we got from Rang Mahal we read all those things we don't have much written evidence of the ancient history whatever evidence we got the archaeological evidence we got but the medieval history we have a large portion of medieval history and we get so much written evidence that our medieval history becomes very long and short In other words when we read the ancient history of India the ancient history of India we don't even get the name of Rajasthan we get the name of a few places that's it but I can also say that when you read ancient India even if you remove Rajasthan it is still far but when you read medieval India if you remove the history of Rajasthan then they have nothing left that you can't read Akbar without Rana Pratap you can't read Aurangzeb you can't read Durgadas Rathod you can't read Alauddin Khilji, Hami, Ratan Singh and Kanadev Sangra so it is medieval history and it is very rich in Rajasthan we got a lot of evidence of it based on that evidence we found that it has the history of different countries those countries were called the princely states you can call them a country you can call them a state you can call them a state there were different dynasties there is Gohil dynasty there is Rathod dynasty there is Chauhan dynasty there is Pratihar dynasty we read the history of different dynasties today we will start the history of those dynasties most of you know that when we talk about dynasties when we talk about princely states the biggest princely state or the best princely states if you believe that it is called the 7th princely state and we have a lot of names like Kumbha, Sangha, Pratap we are familiar with them from 3rd class to 10th class there is a part of them in some form or the other because we are familiar with them because it has a long history so we start from there another reason to start medieval history is that our culture depends on medieval history what will come in culture who made forts in culture who made temples what is their architecture who made paintings how handicrafts were developed we read about all these things who made all this in Rajasthan Raja Maharajas Raja Maharajas history is read in medieval so the cultural portion which is connected to history is read in medieval so when we read this it will help us in reading culture so what we will see today is the history of medieval we will see the history of medieval in the history of medieval we will talk about what was there and what was not so in the history of medieval first of all, when I say a word I said a word, medieval a question arises in your mind what is medieval what is that part of Rajasthan which we can call medieval generally when I ask you you will think of Chittorgad Chittorgad the area around Chittorgad was medieval exactly if I ask you more you will say Udaipur if any of you is from medieval you will say our Rajasthan used to be in that we include Bhilwada in that then someone will say that Pratapgad was built after breaking Chittorgad some of Chittorgad's buildings were built in that some of Udaipur's buildings were built in that so include that generally some of the districts of southern Rajasthan we can include them in medieval so which are those districts so when we see those districts you can take Chittorg in that you take Udaipur in that Rajsamand Bhilwada and Pratapgad this area used to be in medieval you will see later till the time our medieval classes will continue any place will be related to these districts the biggest problem in history whenever a place comes whenever a war comes whenever a king has to go from one place to another first thing that comes to our mind is where is this place when and where so you notice whenever we talk about Mewar wherever I talk it will be in Chittor, Udaipur, Rajsamand or Bhilwada or Pratapgad this is a big portion of Mewar there is another logic behind this when you talk about Mewar what we often do is people from western Rajasthan or people from eastern Rajasthan don't know much about Mewar or people from southern Rajasthan don't know much about Mewar so we will be asked what is there in Mewar and students will start telling Udaipur, Chittorgad, Rajsamand, Bhilwada Pratapgad, Dungarpur, Banswada just keep that in mind don't include Dungarpur, Banswada this portion is separate when we study Dungarpur, Banswada I will tell you more about them this portion of Mewar is called Vagad in Rajasthan this is called Vagad in Rajasthan keep this in mind it will be useful later many people ask what all places are included in Vagad Dungarpur and Banswada we will study further where is Vagdi language spoken in Vagad in Dungarpur and Banswada when you study the geography of Rajasthan or see the map of Rajasthan where is Dungarpur and Banswada it is in Gujarat if someone asks you what is the dialect of Rajasthan which has Gujarati influence what will be the Gujarati influence it is close to Gujarat Vagad so many things are related to each other Dungarpur and Banswada is separate from Vagad rest of the south Rajasthan districts the 5 districts I told you are in Mewar although in Pratapgarh some parts of Banswada were included but most of Pratapgarh was part of Mewar keep this in mind it is written what all areas of Rajasthan are included we can see it from the map when we see it from the map you can see it is written see Bheelwada Bheelwada Rajsamand Udaipur Chittorgarh Pratapgarh India map Rajasthan map South Rajasthan South Rajasthan India in India South Rajasthan in Rajasthan basically the 5 districts we can include them in Mewar keep this in mind ask where is Mewar even if you don't ask you will know Rajasthan is such a subject in many subjects it comes in pre not in mens it comes in mens not in pre it comes in pre not in mens RPC member will ask are you familiar with the land of Rajasthan or not from the whole of Rajasthan but from the area you belong and because Mewar is historically rich so the history of Mewar is asked so someone will ask you about Mewar Mewar area geographical expansion which areas used to come and which didn't so we should know everything I told you when we move forward it is written here ancient names of Mewar so the thing is what we call Mewar today it used to be called Mewar earlier or it used to be some other name this question is asked a lot so Ganesha used to call it Mewar so what he used to do it used to be called Medpath Medpath it used to be called Medpath and with the advent of Medpath it slowly became Mewar so how did it become Medpath now there are a lot of theories some say that a Mayor used to go here
